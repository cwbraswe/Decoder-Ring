# Decoder-Ring
This repository contains three decoding tools implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The tools provide functionality for decoding messages encrypted using three different methods: the Caesar Shift, the Polybius Square, and the Substitution method.

Caesar Shift Method
The Caesar Shift method, also known as the Caesar Cipher, is a simple substitution cipher technique. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. The user can specify the shift value, and the tool will decrypt the encoded message accordingly.

Polybius Method
The Polybius Method, named after the ancient Greek historian Polybius, is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter with a pair of coordinates corresponding to its position in a grid. The tool allows the user to enter the coordinates and decrypt the encoded message.

Substitution Method
The Substitution Method is a more advanced substitution cipher that replaces each letter with a different letter or symbol based on a predetermined mapping. The tool enables the user to provide the substitution mapping and decrypt the encoded message accordingly.

Usage
To use the decoding tools, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/decoding-tools.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd decoding-tools
3. Open the file in a web browser.
4. Enter the encoded message into the input field.
5. Adjust any specific settings required by the decoding method (e.g., shift value for Caesar Shift).
6. Click the "Decode" button.
7. The decoded message will be displayed on the screen.
Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your needs. The tool is contained in the index.html file and includes JavaScript and CSS styles in their own files.
